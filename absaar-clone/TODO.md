# Fix GitHub Pages Deployment Error

## Problem
- gh-pages is looking for 'build' directory but Vite builds to 'dist' by default
- Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'build'

## Solution Plan
- [x] Analyze current configuration
- [x] Update vite.config.js to build to 'build' directory instead of 'dist'
- [x] Add .nojekyll file to prevent Jekyll processing
- [x] Create public directory for future builds
- [x] Test deployment - SUCCESS!

## Steps to Complete
1. [x] Configure Vite build output directory to 'build'
2. [x] Add .nojekyll file to build directory
3. [x] Create public/.nojekyll for future builds
4. [x] Test gh-pages deployment - SUCCESSFUL!

## âœ… DEPLOYMENT FIXED!
The GitHub Pages deployment error has been resolved. The site should now deploy successfully.
