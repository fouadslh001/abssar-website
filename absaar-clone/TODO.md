# Fix GitHub Pages Deployment Error

## Problem
- gh-pages is looking for 'build' directory but Vite builds to 'dist' by default
- Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'build'

## Solution Plan
- [x] Analyze current configuration
- [ ] Update vite.config.js to build to 'build' directory instead of 'dist'
- [ ] Test the build process
- [ ] Verify deployment configuration

## Steps to Complete
1. [x] Configure Vite build output directory to 'build'
2. [ ] Test build process
3. [ ] Verify gh-pages deployment works
